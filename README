RulesKeeper SIGAR aim is to collect system metrics provided by the award winning SIGAR and to publish them to a RulesKeeper Server URL.
This standalone application will have to be installed on each server you would like to monitor and will need a running RulesKeeper Server.

```
RulesKeeper SIGAR can be configured by updating the content of conf/ruleskeeper-sigar.properties
Here is the default configuration file with comment explaining the goal of each parameter:
ruleskeeper.server.url:             http://localhost:9000
# when do we want to gather system data and send them to ruleskeeper server ?
ruleskeeper.sigar.refresh.cron:     0 0/5 * * * ?
# default cpu alert warn/error thresholds
ruleskeeper.sigar.cpu.defaultWarnThreshold: 10
ruleskeeper.sigar.cpu.defaultErrorThreshold: 30
# default memory alert warn/error thresholds
ruleskeeper.sigar.memory.defaultWarnThreshold: 10
ruleskeeper.sigar.memory.defaultErrorThreshold: 30
# default filesystem alert warn/error thresholds
ruleskeeper.sigar.fs.defaultWarnThreshold: 10
ruleskeeper.sigar.fs.defaultErrorThreshold: 30
# gather CPU data ? Y or N
ruleskeeper.sigar.gathering.cpu.active: Y
# gather Memory data ? Y or N
ruleskeeper.sigar.gathering.memory.active: Y
# gather File System data ? Y or N
ruleskeeper.sigar.gathering.fs.active: Y
The minimum parameter to update is: ruleskeeper.server.url to specify where the collected data will be published.
By default CPU, Memory and File System are monitored but this can be turned off by changing:
ruleskeeper.sigar.gathering.cpu.active
ruleskeeper.sigar.gathering.memory.active
ruleskeeper.sigar.gathering.fs.active
```

In this configuration, metrics are collected every 5 minutes and published once they are retrieved one by one. An enhancement is scheduled to be able to choice if it's required to publish collected data one by one or in bulk : #3 option: send data in bulk or one by one
